h1. Introduction

This code _used to_ power http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com, a "single serving site":http://isthisyourpaperonsingleservingsites.com/ that tells you whether or not a web site appears to be down. The author no longer owns or operates this domain.

h1. Installation (Or, Why You're Probably Not Installing This)

This code is provided mostly as an example resource for other developers seeking to learn about "Google App Engine":http://code.google.com/appengine/. In the unlikely case that you want to install a clone of my site, complete with advertising and such, feel free to do so I guess. That's pretty weird, dude.
